Made for a university class project.

Program: C3P0
Description: This program is a simulation between C3P0 and other beings or objects. Each generation of the simulation starts with C3P0 introducing himself to the object along with a message that is directly dependant on his current mood state and the type of obect he is (Robot). The object C3P0 introduced himself to then intoduces itself with a message dependant on it's current mood and type (Robot, Person, Computer, Inanimate Object, Spaceship). If the message is happy, C3P0's mood goes up. If it's sad his mood goes down. If it's neutral, it will randomly choose to go up or down slightly. Simulation ends when C3P0's state has either reached 0, 100 or if 1,000 generations have passed.
